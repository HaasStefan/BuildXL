# Walkthrough: Building and running a simple program

In this walkthrough, we will specify a build that consists of compiling a C++ program, running the resulting executable,
and deploying the result of running the executable to a designated output folder. The example in this walkthrough will
expose the uses of transformer functions in DScript built-in *Sdk.Transformers* to create process pip, write-file pip, and
copy-file pip. The example in this walkthrough can be found in [HelloWorld](../../../../Examples/Walkthrough/HelloWorld).

## Prerequisites

The example in this walkthrough runs both on Linux and Windows.
For Windows, since we are going to use `g++` compiler tool to compile our example C++ program,
you need to install the latest version of Mingw-w64 via MSYS2, which provides up-to-date native builds of GNU C++ tools
and libraries. You can download the latest installer from the [MSYS2 page](https://www.msys2.org/), and then follow
the installation instructions on the MSYS2 website to install Mingw-w64 install the GNU compiler toolset.

## Build specification

Our build specification consists only of a single module called `HelloWorld`, as shown in the configuration file
`config.dsc`:
```typescript
config({
    resolvers: [
        {
            kind: "DScript",
            modules: [ f`module.config.dsc` ]
        },
    ],
    mounts: Context.isWindowsOS()
        ? [
            {
                name: a`MSys`,
                path: p`C:/msys64`,
                trackSourceFileChanges: true,
                isReadable: true
            },
          ]
        : []
});
```
Especially for Windows build, since we are going to use Mingw, installed in `C:\msys64` by default, we need be
able to track files in that installation folder. To that end, we specify a readable and trackable mount for
`C:\msys64`. For Linux build, we do not need to add another mount because BuildXL automatically adds `/bin`, `/usr/bin`,
`/usr/lib`, and `/usr/include` as readable and trackable mounts.

The C++ program to be compiled in this build is a program that copies a file from one location (first argument) to
another (second argument):
```c++
#include <fstream>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    std::ifstream in_file(argv[1]);
    std::ofstream out_file(argv[2]);

    out_file << in_file.rdbuf();
    return 0;
} 
```

The DScript spec `HelloWorld.dsc` describes what the build should do. The first step in the build is to compile
the C++ program itself by creating a process pip using the `Transformer.execute` function:
```typescript
// Compile main.cpp to main.exe.
const outputDir = d`${Context.getMount("ObjectRoot").path}`;
const mainExePath = p`${outputDir}/main.exe`;
const mainCompileResult = Transformer.execute({
    tool: {
        exe: Context.isWindowsOS() ? f`C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin/g++.exe` : f`/usr/bin/g++`,
        dependsOnCurrentHostOSDirectories: true,
        prepareTempDirectory: true,
        untrackedDirectoryScopes: Context.isWindowsOS()
            ? [d`C:/msys64/ucrt64`]
            : undefined
    },
    arguments: [
        Cmd.argument(Artifact.input(f`main.cpp`)),
        Cmd.option("-o", Artifact.output(mainExePath))
    ],
    workingDirectory: d`.`,
    environmentVariables: Context.isWindowsOS()
        ? [{ name: "PATH", value: p`C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin` }]
        : undefined
});
```
The tool that the process pip is going to execute is `g++`. By specifying it as an executable (`exe`) in the `tool`
definition, the process pip establishes a static dependency on the `g++` file. For simplicity, we untrack file
accesses under system directories, like `/bin`, `/lib`, `/usr/bin` because we decide that they are not relevant for caching
the pip. By untracking a directory, the runtime monitoring will not report any file access under that directory. In Linux,
this is done by setting `dependsOnCurrentHostOSDirectories` to `true`. For Windows, since we are using Mingw, we manually
untrack the installation folder of `Mingw`, i.e., `C:\msys64\ucrt64`.

When running, the `g++` compiler can create temporary files in the temporary directory. To guarantee a reproducible build,
we need to create a unique temporary directory for the pip, and redirect `TEMP` or `TMP` environment varibles to that
directory. To this end, we simply set `prepareTempDirectory` to `true`.

The resulting executable `main.exe` will be produced in the BuildXL's object root. By default this object root is
the `Out/Objects` folder, where the `Out` folder is adjacent to the configuration file `config.dsc`. 
The arguments for the process specified in the pip is `main.cpp -o Out/Objects/main.exe`. By "tagging" `main.cpp`
with `Artifact.input`, we declare a static dependency on `main.cpp`. We also declare `Out/Objects/main.exe`
as an output path for the pip.

When running on Windows, `g++.exe` needs to find other tools using the `PATH` environment variable. We made this
variable visible for the pip, but we restrict the value to the path needed by `g++.exe`.

The next step is to create a file `main.in` that `main.exe` will read as an input. For this, we are creating a write-file
pip:
```typescript
// Write input file for main.exe.
const mainInput = Transformer.writeAllLines(p`${outputDir}/main.in`, ["Hello, world!"]);
```
This pip will write "Hello, world!" at `Out/Objects/main.in`.

Once we have pips for `main.exe` and for writing input file `main.in`, we create a process pip that will execute `main.exe`
on `main.in`:
```typescript
// Run main.exe to produce main.out.
const mainExe = mainCompileResult.getOutputFile(mainExePath);
const mainOutputPath = p`${outputDir}/main.out`;
const mainRunResult = Transformer.execute({
    tool: {
        exe: mainExe,
        dependsOnCurrentHostOSDirectories: true
    },
    arguments: [
        Cmd.argument(Artifact.input(mainInput)),
        Cmd.argument(Artifact.output(mainOutputPath))
    ],
    workingDirectory: outputDir,
    environmentVariables: Context.isWindowsOS()
        ? [{ name: "PATH", value: p`C:/msys64/ucrt64/bin` }]
        : undefined
});
```
This process pip simply run `Out/Objects/main.exe Out/Objects/main.in Out/Objects/main.out`. Note that, by setting `main.exe`
as the executable of this pip, this pip establishes a dependency on the pip the produces `main.exe`. Also, the content of
`main.exe` will be used as part of the cache key of this pip.

Finally, we simply duplicate `main.out` to `main_copy.out` by copying it using a copy-file pip:
```typescript
// Copy main.out to main_copy.out.
const mainOutputCopy = Transformer.copyFile(mainRunResult.getOutputFile(mainOutputPath), p`${outputDir}/main_copy.out`);
```

The constructed build graph looks like the following:

## Running the example

You can run the example by invoking this command:
```console
> ./bxl /c:config.dsc
```
The output of the run will be like:
```console

[0:05] -- Cache savings: 0.000% of 2 included processes. 0 excluded via filtering.
Build Succeeded
    Log Directory: /BuildXL/Examples/Walkthrough/HelloWorld/Out/Logs
```
The build has 2 process pips as also shown by the build graph. If you check the `Out/Objects` folder, you will
see the `main_copy.out` file containing "Hello, world!".

If we run the build again without changing anything, we will have 100% cache hit, i.e., cache hits for both process pips:
